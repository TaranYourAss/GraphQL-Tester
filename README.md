gqlmap is is an open source penetration testing tool that maps GraphQL engines and automates the process of detecting and exploiting GraphQL vulnerabilities.  

#### Current Detections
- Directive Overloading
- Alias Overloading
- Array-based Query Batching
- Field Duplication


## Usage
```
python3 gqlmap.py --url=https://{WEBAPP}.com/gql/v2 --cookies='session=abc123; extra=123abc' --max_overload_response=30

```
## Requirements  
cloudscraper  
plotext  
requests  
```
pip install cloudscraper, plotext, requests
```

## Overloading Info
gqlmap by default will attempt multiple types of overloads to map what the GraphQL enginge is vulnerable to.  
<br>
This is done by coninuously doubling the fields, directives, aliases, etc within each GraphQL query until a maximum set timeout or overload count is reached:  
> query alias_test {alias1: __typename alias2: __typename}  
> query alias_test {alias1: __typename alias2: __typename alias2: __typename alias3: __typename alias4: __typename}  
<br>
gqlmap takes a maximalist approach to overload testing to fully ensure denial-of-service is possible, without fully causing a denial-of-service of the application.  Applications may allow large amount of aliases, directives, fields, etc before rejecting/filtering or timing-out queries.  
  
If the GraphQL endpoint does not either:  
- limit directives, aliases, fields, etc
- filter on requests with excessive body-size
- utilize execution timeouts  

you should see the response time continously increase with the number of overload attmempts.  

> [!WARNING]
> Queries designed to overload the GraphQL engine may lead to a denial-of-service of the entire GraphQL engine, as well as resource exhaustion where a significant amount of computational resources are used to parse and validate the non-existent directives, which can result in memory exhaustion or CPU spikes.
> Always utilize either of the --max_overload_count or --max_overload_response arguments to safely test the application.  

> [!NOTE]  
> By default, gqlmap will end if the app took longer than 60s to respond or if the overload count exceeds 100,000.  
> The script only supports POST requests and formats each query as JSON within the request body.

> {"query": "query overload {__typename @include(if:true) @include(if:true) @include(if:true)}"}
